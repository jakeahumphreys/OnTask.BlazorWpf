## WPF / Blazor
This application is written using Blazor, hosted inside a Windows Presentation Framework
application. It's in a similar manner to how MAUI Blazor hybrid works, but I decided I wasn't going to
develop a mobile application so the windows portion is all I needed.

## Technologies
- WPF / Blazor
- [MudBlazor](https://mudblazor.com/)
- EntityFramework
- Bootstrap (Rarely but it's there)

## Planned Features
- Data Import/Export
- Task Labels
- File Upload
- Probably more
